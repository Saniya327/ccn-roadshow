# ccn-roadshow
ODF changes were added to the orders-database.yaml and a new file called pvc.yaml. The latter has the pvc definition and the claim is used in
the orders database. Similar definitions and claims can be used in other databases (inventory and catalog) to ensure persistence accross 
inventory and catalog.
